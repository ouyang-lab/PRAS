PRAS: predicting functional targets of RNA binding proteins based on CLIP-seq peaks

We designed a tool, Protein-RNA Association Strength (PRAS), for RBP functional targets prediction.
Given the binding  (from CLIP-seq) and reference site (pre-known or interested site) information, it can score genes by combining the binding intensity and position information.
PRAS outputs the PRAS score of each interested gene.
